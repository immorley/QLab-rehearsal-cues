Rehearsal Cues from Slices/Markers

one script creates load-to-cue and start cues for each marker in a cue. labeled "markers" do not translate to cues. 2nd file is a work around

the other script creates load-to-cue and start cues based of a CSV. Apple Numbers app is required. example CSV is included. the CSV is based off of the CSV that exports from Adobe Audition.
